# Token-Compression-Algo
A token-based compression algorithm.

## How to run:
If you want to compress a .txt file, place it in the same directory as the Compressor.java file, then make a call to the compressor() method with the filename as a parameter. The program will create a new file under the filename with "_compressed" appended to it. Currently only compression is supported, but decompression is soon to be implemented.
